<!-- Stack -->
Stack: It is a data structure used to store static data. Static data refers to data whose size is known by the engine during compile time. In JavaScript, static data includes primitive values like strings, numbers, boolean, null, and undefined. References that point to objects and functions are also included. A fixed amount of memory is allocated for static data. This process is known as static memory allocation.

Stack(primitive) Heap(non-primitive)

Stack = which takes copy of the declared data type. here if we change the value first declared value wont change

<!-- Heap -->
Heap: It is used to store objects and functions in JavaScript. The engine doesnâ€™t allocate a fixed amount of memory. Instead, it allocates more space as required.

Heap = Heap is a different space for storing data where JavaScript stores objects and functions. which takes the reference of the data type. here if we change the value first declared value also get change.
